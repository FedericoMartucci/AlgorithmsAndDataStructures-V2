# Algorithms and Data Structures Repository (Version 2)

This repository is dedicated to studying algorithms and data structures in the C language as part of a university course in Algorithms and Data Structures.

## Description

This repository contains the source code of various algorithms and data structures studied in the university course on Algorithms and Data Structures. It serves as a reference and resource for students who wish to review the concepts learned in class and delve deeper into mastering these topics.

## Contents

The repository's content includes C implementations of various algorithms and data structures commonly studied in university courses, such as:

- Search and sorting algorithms.
- Fundamental data structures: linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, etc.
- Graph algorithms: traversals, shortest path algorithms, minimum spanning tree algorithms, etc.

## Repository Organization

The repository is organized according to the units in the exercise guide, along with two additional folders:

- `UnidadN`: Implementations related to Unit N exercises.
- `Bibliotecas`: General-purpose code and libraries.
- `TDA`: Implementations of various data structures.

Each folder contains the corresponding source code, accompanied by documentation files when necessary.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. If you find any errors in the code, you can submit corrections through pull requests. Additionally, if you wish to add new implementations of algorithms or data structures, feel free to do so following the contribution guidelines.

## Versions

- **Version 2:** This is the complete version of the repository for the university course in Algorithms and Data Structures.
